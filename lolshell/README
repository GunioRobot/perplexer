This is a very simple shell. It currently implements the following:

   1. If the word is a built-in command, then it executes the command in the same process
   2. If not, it assumes that the full path of an executable is provided, and it executes it in a child process
   3. =&= - Processes can be sent to the background with =&=
   4. =jobs= lists all background jobs
   5. =ctrl-c= - delivers =SIGINT= to the process in the foreground
   6. =ctrl-z= - delivers =SIGSTP= to each process in the process in the foreground
   7. =bg job= Run the job in the background that is currently stopped
   8. =fg job= Change a stopped or running background job to run in the foreground
   9. =kill job= terminate the job
   10. => and <= Support stdin/stdout redirection
   11. =quit= terminate the shell
   12. reap zombies
   =job= can either be _PID_ or _JID_
